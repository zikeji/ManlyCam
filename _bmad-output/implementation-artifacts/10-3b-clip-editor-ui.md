# Story 10.3b: Clip Editor UI — Stream-Integrated Timeline Scrubber

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As an **authenticated user**,
I want an inline clip editor with HLS video playback and a visual timeline scrubber with drag handles,
So that I can preview and precisely select the clip range before submitting.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Clip button behavior** — When the clip button in `BroadcastConsole.vue` is clicked: (1) disable the button immediately (prevents double-click race), (2) call `fetchSegmentRange`, (3) if the response indicates `streamStartedAt` and `Date.now() - streamStartedAt < 60_000`, re-enable the button and show tooltip "Stream just started — try again in a moment" — do NOT proceed to step 4, (4) if the 60s check passes, begin loading the HLS stream. The button stays disabled until HLS is ready OR the request fails. If the user cancels during the HLS loading phase (after 60s check passed), call `hls.destroy()` to clean up before re-enabling the button. When the stream is not live, the clip button is disabled with tooltip "Stream is offline". The 60s check happens at clip button click time only — no background polling required.

2. **Seamless stream swap** — On HLS ready: CSS-hide the WHEP `<video>` element (`visibility: hidden` only — do NOT add `position: absolute`, which would remove it from flow and collapse the container height) — do NOT pause or unmount it. Reveal the HLS `<video>` in the same container area. On submit or cancel: reverse the swap. WHEP resumes instantly because it was never paused. **Component ownership:** `ClipEditor.vue` is rendered inside `StreamPlayer.vue` (as a sibling of the WHEP `<video>`, not inside `BroadcastConsole`). `BroadcastConsole` emits a `clip-editor-open` event with the fetched segment range as its payload to parent `WatchView.vue`. `WatchView` holds `clipEditorOpen` (boolean) and `clipSegmentRange` (the range data) as state and passes both as props to `StreamPlayer`, which passes them down to `ClipEditor`. This is the correct data flow — `BroadcastConsole` and `StreamPlayer` are siblings in `WatchView`. **Desktop only:** The clip editor is desktop-only. The clip button in `BroadcastConsole` must be hidden on mobile (same breakpoint used for other desktop-only controls). `ClipEditor` is never rendered on mobile.

3. **Clip editor overlay** — The clip editor overlays the video area (NOT a Dialog/modal). It contains: the HLS `<video>` player filling the stream area, a timeline scrubber bar at the bottom of the video area, name input + description textarea + share-to-chat switch below the video, and submit/cancel buttons. The overlay uses `position: absolute` and must be a **direct sibling of the WHEP `<video>` element** within `StreamPlayer`'s container — it must NOT be nested inside the zoomed `<video>` element or any ancestor that has a CSS `transform` applied (the zoom composable applies `transform: zoomTransform` directly to the WHEP `<video>`, not to the container — siblings are safe).

4. **Timeline scrubber** — Visual sliding-window track showing available HLS buffer range. Left bound clamped to `max(stream_started_at, hlsEarliest)`. Default selection: last 30 seconds at time of opening, auto-advancing in real-time as the live stream progresses (the right edge of the selection tracks the live edge until the user interacts with the scrubber).
   - **Dual drag handles**: left and right handles resize the selection from either end. Handles enforce min/max distance driven by `minDurationSeconds` / `maxDurationSeconds` from server.
   - **Click-drag inside selection**: moves the entire selection as a unit (both handles move together). Stops auto-advance when user drags.
   - **Play/pause toggle button**: plays HLS from `startTime` through `endTime` of the current selection. Playhead position shown on the track. When playhead reaches `endTime`, playback **loops** back to `startTime`. Adjusting a handle while playing continues playback with the new bounds (does not stop). Clicking the track to seek also continues playback from the new position.
   - **Seekable**: click anywhere on the track to reposition the playhead without stopping playback.
   - **Min/max enforcement**: when a handle is dragged closer than `minDurationSeconds` to the opposite handle, the dragged handle stops (clamps in place — it does NOT push the opposite handle). When a handle would exceed `maxDurationSeconds`, it likewise stops. Visual feedback (handle highlight or track color change) when a limit is reached. If the available buffer is shorter than `minDurationSeconds`, the submit button is disabled with label "Buffer too short to clip".
   - **"Go Live" re-engage**: when auto-advance is paused (user has interacted), a small "● Live" badge appears on the right side of the scrubber. Clicking it re-enables auto-advance using a **sliding window**: the selection duration is preserved and the right edge snaps to the current live edge (left edge = live edge − selection duration).
   - **Stream offline during edit**: if `streamState` prop transitions to `explicit-offline` or `unreachable` while the editor is open, stop auto-advance and polling, show an inline warning "Stream went offline — you can still clip what was buffered", and keep the editor open. The user may submit with the current selection or cancel.

5. **Preset buttons** — 30s, 1min, 2min buttons below the scrubber. Values driven by server config: only show presets where `presetSeconds <= maxDurationSeconds`. Clicking a preset sets the selection to the last N seconds of available buffer. If available buffer < preset duration, clamp to available (right edge = latest, left edge = earliest). If the resulting selection is shorter than `minDurationSeconds`, the submit button is disabled (same "Buffer too short to clip" label). Stops auto-advance.

6. **Duration config from server** — `GET /api/clips/segment-range` response expanded to include `minDurationSeconds`, `maxDurationSeconds`, and `streamStartedAt` (all required fields, in addition to existing `earliest` and `latest`). Server reads duration limits from `CLIP_MIN_DURATION_SECONDS` and `CLIP_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS` env vars. `earliest` is clamped to `max(stream_started_at, hlsEarliest)`. **Critical:** `createClip` must use the same clamped lower bound when validating `startTime` — compute `effectiveEarliest = max(streamStartedAt, hlsEarliest)` and validate `startTime >= effectiveEarliest`.

7. **HLS proxy route** — New `GET /api/stream/hls/*` wildcard route (auth-required via `requireAuth`) that proxies requests to `${MTX_HLS_URL}/cam/{wildcard}`. Use Hono's wildcard syntax `*` (NOT named param `:path`) to capture multi-segment paths (e.g. `video1_stream.m3u8`, `video1_stream/seg001.ts`). Reject any path containing `..` with 400. The proxy must forward the response body, content-type, and status code. On fetch error (mediamtx unreachable): return 502. Note: the HLS proxy serves the **media stream** for `hls.js` playback — it is separate from `GET /api/clips/segment-range` which already proxies segment timestamp data on the server side.

8. **Env vars** — `CLIP_MIN_DURATION_SECONDS` (default: `10`) and `CLIP_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS` (default: `120`) added to `env.ts` as `z.coerce.number().default(...)`. Replace the hardcoded `MAX_DURATION_S = 2 * 60` in `clipService.ts` with `env.CLIP_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS`. Add min duration validation in `createClip`: reject with 422 if `duration < env.CLIP_MIN_DURATION_SECONDS`.

9. **ClipModal.vue removed** — Delete `ClipModal.vue` and `ClipModal.test.ts`. Create `ClipEditor.vue` and `ClipEditor.test.ts` as replacements. Update `BroadcastConsole.vue` to remove `ClipModal` entirely — `BroadcastConsole` does NOT render `ClipEditor`. `ClipEditor` renders inside `StreamPlayer` (see AC #2). `BroadcastConsole` only fetches segment range on clip button click and emits `clip-editor-open`.

10. **Quality gates** — `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run test --coverage` all pass from both `apps/server` and `apps/web`. Zikeji smoke-tests on hardware before close.

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Server

- [ ] Task 1: Add env vars to `env.ts` (AC: #8)
  - [ ] Add `CLIP_MIN_DURATION_SECONDS` as `z.coerce.number().default(10)`
  - [ ] Add `CLIP_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS` as `z.coerce.number().default(120)`

- [ ] Task 2: Update `clipService.ts` to use env vars (AC: #8)
  - [ ] Replace `const MAX_DURATION_S = 2 * 60` with `env.CLIP_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS`
  - [ ] Add min duration validation: `if (durationSeconds < env.CLIP_MIN_DURATION_SECONDS)` throw 422
  - [ ] Update the hardcoded error message `"Clip duration must not exceed 2 minutes"` to dynamically reference the env var (e.g., `"Clip duration must not exceed ${env.CLIP_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS} seconds"`)
  - [ ] Import `env` if not already imported (it is already imported)

- [ ] Task 3: Expand `getSegmentRange` response and fix `createClip` clamp consistency (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Change return type to include `minDurationSeconds`, `maxDurationSeconds`, and `streamStartedAt`
  - [ ] Clamp returned `earliest` to `max(stream_started_at, hlsEarliest)` — the earliest the user can select must not predate when the stream started
  - [ ] **Critical:** `createClip` in `clipService.ts` must use the SAME clamped lower bound when validating `startTime`. Current code at line ~392 validates `start < range.earliest` against the raw HLS earliest. Fix: compute `effectiveEarliest = new Date(Math.max(streamStart.getTime(), range.earliest.getTime()))` and validate `start >= effectiveEarliest`. Without this fix, the frontend (using clamped earliest from `getSegmentRange`) can submit a valid `startTime` that the server rejects.

- [ ] Task 4: Add HLS proxy route `GET /api/stream/hls/*` (AC: #7)
  - [ ] Add wildcard route to `apps/server/src/routes/stream.ts` using Hono's `*` syntax (NOT `:path`)
  - [ ] Require auth via `requireAuth` middleware
  - [ ] Extract wildcard path via `c.req.param('*')` (Hono v4 exposes the wildcard match as the literal key `'*'` — do NOT use `.replace()` and do NOT use `c.req.param('path')`); reject with 400 if path contains `..`
  - [ ] Proxy to `${env.MTX_HLS_URL}/cam/${wildcardPath}` — forward body, content-type, status code
  - [ ] Handle errors gracefully (502 if mediamtx HLS is unreachable)
  - [ ] Do NOT configure `withCredentials` in `hls.js` — the proxy is same-origin; cookies are sent automatically
  - [ ] Note: `stream.ts` already defines the `HOP_BY_HOP` header set twice (lines ~42 and ~82). Before adding a third copy for the HLS proxy, extract it to a single `const HOP_BY_HOP` at the top of the file and reuse it across all proxy handlers.

### Frontend

- [ ] Task 5: Install `hls.js` dependency (AC: #2)
  - [ ] `pnpm --filter @manlycam/web add hls.js`
  - [ ] Use default import: `import Hls from 'hls.js'` — the light build (`hls.js/dist/hls.light.min.js`) is NOT required since we don't need alternate audio/subtitle tracks; the overhead is negligible

- [ ] Task 6: Create `useHlsPlayer` composable `apps/web/src/composables/useHlsPlayer.ts` (AC: #2, #4)
  - [ ] Initialize `hls.js` instance with the auth-gated HLS proxy URL: `/api/stream/hls/index.m3u8`
  - [ ] Import: `import Hls from 'hls.js'` (default build; light build not required since alternate audio/subs are negligible overhead)
  - [ ] Attach to a provided `<video>` element ref
  - [ ] Expose: `isReady` (boolean ref — HLS manifest loaded and playable), `error` (ref — null or error message string), `destroy()`, `seekTo(time)`, `play()`, `pause()`, `currentTime` (ref), `duration` (ref), `programDateTimeMs` (ref — wall-clock epoch ms corresponding to `hls.currentTime === 0`; updated on each `FRAG_LOADED` event from `data.frag.programDateTime`; enables ClipEditor to compute `wallClockMs = programDateTimeMs.value + hls.currentTime * 1000`)
  - [ ] Handle `Hls.Events.MANIFEST_PARSED` to signal readiness
  - [ ] Handle `Hls.Events.FRAG_LOADED`: update `programDateTimeMs` from `data.frag.programDateTime` (epoch ms, defined when mediamtx `useAbsoluteTimestamp: true` is set); skip update if `data.frag.programDateTime` is undefined or 0
  - [ ] Handle `Hls.Events.ERROR`: if `fatal` is true, set `error.value` to a user-friendly message based on error type:
    - `Hls.ErrorTypes.NETWORK_ERROR` with HTTP 502: "Stream unavailable — server cannot reach media source"
    - `Hls.ErrorTypes.NETWORK_ERROR` other: "Network error — check your connection"
    - `Hls.ErrorTypes.MEDIA_ERROR`: "Playback error — try again"
    - Other: "Failed to load stream"
  - [ ] On destroy: detach media, destroy Hls instance, clear error state
  - [ ] Note: the proxy is same-origin (`/api/stream/hls/...`) so the session cookie is sent automatically — do NOT configure `withCredentials` or `xhrSetup`

- [ ] Task 7: Update `useClipCreate.ts` composable (AC: #1, #6)
  - [ ] Update `SegmentRange` interface to include `minDurationSeconds`, `maxDurationSeconds`, `streamStartedAt` (all required fields)
  - [ ] The interface stays in `useClipCreate.ts` (frontend-only) with implicit coupling to server response shape — no `packages/types` change needed since this is a client-side API response type, not a shared WS message type
  - [ ] Expose `fetchSegmentRange` return type matching expanded server response
  - [ ] Add `isStreamTooNew(streamStartedAt: string): boolean` helper — returns `true` if `Date.now() - new Date(streamStartedAt).getTime() < 60_000`

- [ ] Task 8: Create `ClipEditor.vue` component `apps/web/src/components/stream/ClipEditor.vue` (AC: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #9)
  - [ ] Overlay layout: absolute-positioned as a sibling of the WHEP `<video>` inside `StreamPlayer`'s container — NOT inside BroadcastConsole, NOT nested in any transformed element
  - [ ] Accepts props: `segmentRange` (the range data from WatchView, passed through StreamPlayer), `streamState`, `open` (Boolean — true when the editor is visible), and emits `close` (submit or cancel)
  - [ ] HLS `<video>` element using `useHlsPlayer` composable
  - [ ] Timeline scrubber:
    - [ ] Track bar representing the available HLS buffer range
    - [ ] Left and right drag handles with pointer event listeners
    - [ ] Selected region highlight between handles
    - [ ] Playhead indicator showing current HLS playback position
    - [ ] Click-to-seek on the track
    - [ ] Click-drag inside selection to move as unit
    - [ ] Auto-advance: right edge tracks live edge until user interaction; "● Live" badge re-enables it
    - [ ] Min/max handle clamping: dragged handle stops at limit; does NOT push opposite handle
    - [ ] **Keyboard accessibility**: scrubber track and handles are focusable; arrow keys move focused handle (±1s per press, ±10s with Shift); Home/End jump to bounds; selection region has `role="slider"` with `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, `aria-valuenow` (current start time), and `aria-label` describing the selection
  - [ ] "Go Live" badge (shown when auto-advance paused): clicking re-enables auto-advance with sliding window; if preserved duration > `maxDurationSeconds`, clamp selection to `maxDurationSeconds` before applying
  - [ ] Stream-offline warning banner when `streamState` changes to offline/unreachable mid-edit; if stream comes back online while editor is open, clear the warning and resume auto-advance polling
  - [ ] Preset buttons (30s, 1min, 2min) — filter by `maxDurationSeconds`
  - [ ] Duration display showing current selection length
  - [ ] Name input (max 200 chars) + description textarea (max 500 chars)
  - [ ] Share-to-chat Switch component
  - [ ] Submit button: disabled when `isSubmitting` or `!canSubmit`; label shows "Creating…" when submitting, "Create Clip" otherwise
  - [ ] Cancel button (calls `onClose` prop/emit)
  - [ ] Loading state while HLS initializes
  - [ ] Error state if HLS fails to load — show error message from `useHlsPlayer.error` with a "Retry" button that re-initializes HLS
  - [ ] Form reset behavior: reset name/description/shareToChat to defaults on mount AND whenever `open` prop transitions to `true` (subsequent opens after lazy-mount, since `onMounted` only fires once); preserve input on cancel; reset on successful submit; preserve input on submit error
  - [ ] **ResizeObserver cleanup**: use `ResizeObserver` on the scrubber track ref to recompute pixel positions on resize; call `observer.disconnect()` in `onUnmounted` to prevent memory leaks
  - [ ] **Error boundary**: wrap HLS initialization in try-catch; if hls.js throws during constructor (e.g., MSE not supported), show "Your browser does not support this feature" error message instead of crashing

- [ ] Task 9: Update `BroadcastConsole.vue` (AC: #1, #9)
  - [ ] Remove `ClipModal` import entirely (ClipEditor renders in StreamPlayer, not here)
  - [ ] Add clip button loading state (spinner while fetchSegmentRange is in-flight)
  - [ ] Clip button disabled immediately on first click until request resolves or fails
  - [ ] Clip button hidden on mobile (desktop only — use same breakpoint as other desktop-only controls)
  - [ ] `fetchSegmentRange` called on click; 60s and offline checks evaluated from response
  - [ ] Emit `clip-editor-open` with segment range data as payload to parent `WatchView` on success
  - [ ] On `fetchSegmentRange` generic error (non-422, e.g. network failure): re-enable the clip button and show a brief Sonner toast error ("Failed to open clip editor — try again")
  - [ ] Note: HLS loading now begins inside `ClipEditor` on mount (lazy) — `BroadcastConsole` only needs to fetch segment range and emit

- [ ] Task 10: Update `StreamPlayer.vue` to render `ClipEditor` (AC: #2, #3)
  - [ ] Accept `clipEditorOpen` prop (Boolean) and `clipSegmentRange` prop from `WatchView`
  - [ ] When `clipEditorOpen` is true: apply `visibility: hidden` (only) to the WHEP `<video>` — do NOT add `position: absolute`, do NOT pause/unmount
  - [ ] **Lazy-mount pattern**: add `hasClipEditorBeenOpened` computed/ref; render `ClipEditor` with `v-if="hasClipEditorBeenOpened"` + `v-show="clipEditorOpen"` — this mounts once on first open, then stays in DOM (kept alive) on subsequent open/close cycles
  - [ ] Pass `streamState`, `:segmentRange="clipSegmentRange"`, and `:open="clipEditorOpen"` as props to `ClipEditor` (note: WatchView's ref is named `clipSegmentRange`; ClipEditor's prop is named `segmentRange`)
  - [ ] Forward ClipEditor's `close` emit as `clip-editor-close` to `WatchView` (i.e., `@close="emit('clip-editor-close')"` on the `<ClipEditor>` tag)
  - [ ] **HLS pause when hidden + re-init on re-open**: Use a watcher in ClipEditor on `open` prop: `watch(() => props.open, (open) => { if (!open) { pause(); } else { /* seek HLS to live edge, reset scrubber to new segmentRange, reset form fields */ } })`. On subsequent opens, the scrubber must re-initialize from the new `segmentRange` prop (the segment range advances between opens) and the form must reset.

- [ ] Task 11: Update `WatchView.vue` to lift `clipEditorOpen` state (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Add `clipEditorOpen` ref (Boolean, default false) and `clipSegmentRange` ref (nullable)
  - [ ] Handle `clip-editor-open` event from `BroadcastConsole` → set `clipSegmentRange` from event payload, set `clipEditorOpen = true`
  - [ ] Handle `clip-editor-close` event (forwarded from `StreamPlayer` as `clip-editor-close`) → set `clipEditorOpen = false`
  - [ ] Pass `clipEditorOpen` and `clipSegmentRange` as props to `StreamPlayer` in all **desktop** layout variants only

- [ ] Task 12: Delete `ClipModal.vue` and `ClipModal.test.ts` (AC: #9)

### Tests

- [ ] Task 13: Server tests (AC: #6, #7, #8)
  - [ ] Update `clipService.test.ts` — test expanded `getSegmentRange` response, min duration validation, env var usage, clamp consistency between getSegmentRange and createClip
  - [ ] Add HLS proxy route tests (auth required, wildcard path capture, `..` rejection, proxy behavior, 502 on upstream error)

- [ ] Task 14: Web tests (AC: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5)
  - [ ] `useHlsPlayer.test.ts` — init, ready state, destroy, error handling (including 502 and network errors), timestamp mapping (mock `Hls.Events.FRAG_LOADED` with `programDateTime` and verify wallClockMs calculation); mock `Hls` class from `hls.js`
  - [ ] `ClipEditor.test.ts` — rendering, preset buttons, form validation, submit/cancel, auto-advance flag, min/max enforcement, stream-offline warning, "Go Live" badge visibility, keyboard accessibility (arrow keys move handles, aria attributes present). **Drag behavior note:** JSDOM does not implement `getBoundingClientRect` (returns all zeroes) or `setPointerCapture`. Test drag interactions by calling the component's internal handler functions directly (extract them or expose via `defineExpose` for test purposes), OR use `/* c8 ignore next */` on the raw pointer math inside drag handlers with a comment explaining JSDOM limitation — do NOT write meaningless tests that exercise zero pixels of drag movement.
  - [ ] Update `useClipCreate.test.ts` — expanded SegmentRange interface, isStreamTooNew helper
  - [ ] Update `BroadcastConsole.test.ts` — clip button emits correct event, loading state, 60s disable, offline disable
  - [ ] Update `WatchView.test.ts` — clipEditorOpen state lifted correctly, passed to StreamPlayer in all layout variants
  - [ ] Update `StreamPlayer.test.ts` — ClipEditor rendered when clipEditorOpen=true, WHEP video hidden

## Dev Notes

### What This Story Replaces

Story 10-3 delivered `ClipModal.vue` — a Dialog-based modal with abstract offset sliders and no video playback. This story replaces it with `ClipEditor.vue` — an inline overlay with an actual HLS video player, a visual timeline scrubber bar, and dual drag handles. The server pipeline (ffmpeg, S3, WS broadcast, rate limiting) from 10-3 is untouched.

### Critical Implementation Details

**HLS Player via hls.js:**

- Use `hls.js` library on ALL browsers including Safari (do NOT use Safari's native HLS support via `<video src="...m3u8">`). This ensures consistent behavior across browsers and avoids maintaining two code paths. hls.js on Safari will use its MSE-based implementation rather than native HLS.
- HLS playlist URL: `/api/stream/hls/index.m3u8` (goes through the new auth-gated proxy route)
- `hls.js` config: the proxy is same-origin (`/api/stream/hls/...`) so the session cookie is sent automatically — do NOT configure `withCredentials` or `xhrSetup`
- mediamtx serves HLS with `useAbsoluteTimestamp: true`, so `#EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME` tags correspond to real wall-clock times — this is how segment timestamps map to clip `startTime`/`endTime`
- The HLS player is ONLY for clip preview. The live stream remains WHEP. Do NOT replace the WHEP player.

**WHEP Hide/Show Pattern and Component Hierarchy:**

- WHEP `<video>` is hidden via CSS (`visibility: hidden` only) — NOT `position: absolute` (that removes it from flow and collapses container height), NOT paused, NOT unmounted
- This ensures the WebRTC peer connection stays alive and healthy
- On clip editor close (submit or cancel), just remove the CSS overrides — WHEP video reappears instantly
- The HLS `<video>` element is created/destroyed with the ClipEditor component lifecycle
- **Component hierarchy (critical):** `ClipEditor` renders inside `StreamPlayer.vue` as a direct sibling of the WHEP `<video>`. It does NOT live inside `BroadcastConsole`. Data flow: `BroadcastConsole` (emits `clip-editor-open`) → `WatchView` (holds `clipEditorOpen` ref) → `StreamPlayer` (receives prop, renders ClipEditor). `WatchView` is the common parent of both `StreamPlayer` and `BroadcastConsole`.
- **Zoom transform isolation (critical):** `useStreamZoom` applies `transform: zoomTransform` directly to the WHEP `<video>` element's inline style — NOT to the container div. `ClipEditor`, as a sibling of `<video>` within the same container, is NOT affected by the zoom transform. Do NOT nest `ClipEditor` inside the `<video>` element or any wrapper that inherits the transform.

**Timeline Scrubber Implementation:**

- The track represents the available HLS buffer range (`earliest` to `latest` from segment-range API)
- Selected region is a colored band between two handle positions
- Handle positions are stored as millisecond offsets from `earliest`
- Pointer events: `pointerdown` on handles for resize, `pointerdown` inside selection for move, `pointerdown` outside selection for seek
- Use `pointermove` + `pointerup` on `document` (not the element) for smooth drag behavior
- Auto-advance: poll `fetchSegmentRange` **5 seconds after each response completes** (not `setInterval` — avoids queuing if responses are slow on the Pi). Right edge of selection follows live edge until user interacts.
- Stop auto-advance on any user scrubber interaction (handle drag, selection drag, preset click)
- Re-enable auto-advance via "● Live" badge: sliding window — preserve selection duration, snap right edge to live edge (`rightMs = latestMs`, `leftMs = rightMs - durationMs`)
- If `fetchSegmentRange` returns an error or 422 (stream went offline): stop polling, lock the last valid range, show inline warning. User may still submit or cancel.

**HLS Timestamp Mapping (critical):**

- mediamtx emits `useAbsoluteTimestamp: true`, so `#EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME` tags in the playlist correspond to real wall-clock times
- `hls.js` exposes `programDateTime` on each fragment via `Hls.Events.FRAG_LOADED` / `LEVEL_LOADED` data — this gives the mapping from `hls.currentTime` (relative media time, seconds from start of playback) to wall-clock
- The scrubber works in wall-clock ms (same units as `earliest`/`latest` from segment-range). The conversion: `wallClockMs = programDateTimeOfFirstFragment + (hls.currentTime * 1000)`
- `submitClip` requires ISO8601 strings: `new Date(selectionStartMs).toISOString()` / `new Date(selectionEndMs).toISOString()`
- `streamStartedAt` in the segment-range response is always a non-null ISO8601 string (the endpoint throws 422 if stream not started, so the non-null guarantee holds)

**Clamping Logic:**

- Left bound of available range: `max(new Date(streamStartedAt).getTime(), new Date(earliest).getTime())`
- Right bound: `new Date(latest).getTime()`
- Selection start ms: `max(leftBoundMs, selectionStartMs)`
- Selection end ms: `min(rightBoundMs, selectionEndMs)`
- Handle distance constraint: `minDurationSeconds * 1000 <= (endMs - startMs) <= maxDurationSeconds * 1000`
- Submit disabled if `(endMs - startMs) < minDurationSeconds * 1000` (show "Buffer too short to clip")

**HLS Proxy Route:**

- Pattern follows existing WHEP proxy in `stream.ts` (lines 20-50)
- Route: `GET /api/stream/hls/*` (wildcard, NOT `:path`) → `${env.MTX_HLS_URL}/cam/${wildcardPath}`
- Extract wildcard path via `c.req.param('*')` (Hono v4 exposes the wildcard match as the literal key `'*'`; do NOT use `.replace()`, do NOT use `c.req.param('path')`)
- Reject paths containing `..` with 400 (path traversal protection)
- Forward response body as-is (binary for `.ts` segments, text for `.m3u8`)
- Forward `Content-Type` header from upstream
- Forward status code from upstream
- On fetch error (mediamtx unreachable): return 502

**Env Var Changes:**

- `CLIP_MIN_DURATION_SECONDS` (default 10) — minimum clip duration in seconds
- `CLIP_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS` (default 120) — maximum clip duration in seconds
- Both use `z.coerce.number()` so they can be set as strings in env files
- These replace the hardcoded `MAX_DURATION_S = 2 * 60` in `clipService.ts`
- Existing `.env.example` files should be updated

**60-Second Stream-Too-New Disable:**

- `GET /api/clips/segment-range` response now includes `streamStartedAt`
- Frontend computes: if `Date.now() - streamStartedAt < 60_000`, clip button is disabled
- This is checked on clip button click, not polled continuously
- Tooltip explains: "Stream just started — try again in a moment"

### Existing Code Patterns to Follow

- **Route proxy pattern:** See WHEP proxy in `apps/server/src/routes/stream.ts` lines 20-80 for request forwarding approach
- **Composable pattern:** See `apps/web/src/composables/useWhep.ts` for media composable structure
- **Overlay pattern:** The ClipEditor should overlay the stream area similar to how `StateOverlay.vue` overlays — using absolute positioning within the stream container
- **Form pattern:** Name/description/switch follows the same pattern as the old `ClipModal.vue` form fields
- **Service singleton:** `clipService.ts` already imports `env` — reuse it for the new env vars
- **Error handling:** Use `new AppError(message, code, statusCode)` from `apps/server/src/lib/errors.ts`
- **Broadcast Console:** Clip button is in the right flank, after the snapshot button

**`streamState` Reactive Dependency:**

- `streamState` is passed as a prop from `StreamPlayer` → `ClipEditor` (StreamPlayer already receives it from WatchView)
- `ClipEditor` uses `watch(() => props.streamState, ...)` to detect transition to `explicit-offline` or `unreachable` and stops polling + shows warning (`watch(props.streamState, ...)` is invalid Vue 3 — always use a getter for primitive props)

**Scrubber Resize Handling:**

- The scrubber's pixel-to-time mapping depends on the track element's `clientWidth`
- Use a `ResizeObserver` on the track container ref; re-compute pixel positions whenever width changes
- This handles browser resize and orientation change without closing the editor

### hls.js Configuration Notes

- `hls.js` must be configured with `liveSyncDurationCount` and `liveMaxLatencyDurationCount` appropriate for a rolling buffer scrubber (not just live-edge playback)
- Set `liveDurationInfinity: true` so the full rolling buffer is accessible, not just the last few segments
- Use `hls.on(Hls.Events.LEVEL_LOADED, ...)` to get program date time mapping for segment timestamps
- `hls.js` does NOT need to be bundled for SSR — it is client-only; guard initialization with `Hls.isSupported()` check

### Project Structure Notes

- HLS proxy route: `apps/server/src/routes/stream.ts` (add to existing stream router)
- Clip service: `apps/server/src/services/clipService.ts` (modify existing)
- Env validation: `apps/server/src/env.ts` (add 2 new vars)
- Web composable (new): `apps/web/src/composables/useHlsPlayer.ts`
- Web composable (modify): `apps/web/src/composables/useClipCreate.ts`
- Web component (new): `apps/web/src/components/stream/ClipEditor.vue`
- Web component (delete): `apps/web/src/components/stream/ClipModal.vue`
- Web component (modify): `apps/web/src/components/stream/BroadcastConsole.vue`
- Web component (modify): `apps/web/src/components/stream/StreamPlayer.vue`
- Web view (modify): `apps/web/src/views/WatchView.vue` (lift clipEditorOpen state)
- Shared types: `packages/types/src/ws.ts` (no changes expected — clip WS types already exist from 10-3)

**Server:**

- `apps/server/src/env.ts` (modify)
- `apps/server/.env.example` (modify — add `CLIP_MIN_DURATION_SECONDS` and `CLIP_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS` with defaults)
- `apps/server/src/services/clipService.ts` (modify)
- `apps/server/src/services/clipService.test.ts` (modify)
- `apps/server/src/routes/clips.ts` (modify — `GET /api/clips/segment-range` response shape expands; no handler logic changes but TypeScript infers the new return type from `getSegmentRange`)
- `apps/server/src/routes/stream.ts` (modify)
- `apps/server/src/routes/stream.test.ts` (modify — add HLS proxy tests)
